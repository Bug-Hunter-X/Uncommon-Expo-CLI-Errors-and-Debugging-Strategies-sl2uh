This error typically occurs when using Expo's managed workflow with a project that has been configured incorrectly or has dependencies that conflict with Expo's environment.  It can manifest in various ways, such as build failures, runtime errors, or unexpected behavior. The underlying cause might be an outdated Expo CLI, incompatible native modules, incorrect package versions, or problems with the project's configuration files (e.g., `app.json`, `package.json`, `eas.json`).
