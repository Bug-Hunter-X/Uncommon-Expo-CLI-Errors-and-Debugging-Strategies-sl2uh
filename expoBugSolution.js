Debugging uncommon Expo CLI errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Check Expo CLI version:** Ensure your Expo CLI is updated (`expo upgrade`).
2. **Review `package.json`:** Verify that all dependencies are compatible with Expo. Check for conflicting or outdated packages.
3. **Inspect `app.json` and `eas.json`:** Look for any syntax errors or misconfigurations in these key files.
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache (`expo prebuild --clean`) and rebuilding the project. 
5. **Examine logs:** Pay close attention to the full error messages provided by the Expo CLI.  They often pinpoint the cause of the problem.
6. **Isolate problematic modules:**  If you suspect a specific dependency is causing issues, try commenting it out to see if the error resolves.
7. **Enable verbose logging:** Run commands with `--verbose` flag (e.g., `expo start --verbose`) for more detailed output.
8. **Consult Expo documentation:** The official Expo documentation is a valuable resource for troubleshooting common and uncommon problems.
9. **Search for similar issues:** Check the Expo community forums and GitHub issues for reports of similar errors.
10. **Simplify your project:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the error.  This will make it easier to diagnose and solve the problem.
